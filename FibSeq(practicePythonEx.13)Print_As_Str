#Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate
#and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can
#use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers
#in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of
#numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two
#numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)


fibSeqList = [1, 1]

userInput = int(input('Please enter the number of values in the Fibonnacci Sequence you want to generage: '))

    return list.append(list[-1] + list[-2])

while len(fibSeqList) <= userInput:
    fibSeq(fibSeqList)

#print(fibSeqList[0:userInput])

for i in fibSeqList[0:userInput - 1]:
    print(i, end = ', ')
print('and ' + str(fibSeqList[-1]))
