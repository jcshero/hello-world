# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I was speaking with a friend recently who is an engineer manager for carbon black.  I told him how I'm interested in automating monotonouse and routine tasks, and he steered me towards the book, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Practical Programming for Total Beginners, by Al Sweigart.  I'm on chapter 4 now.  I haven't learned anything that I can use yet, but I'm excited to get there. 

The extent to my "programming" experience has been in microsoft excel.  I can work with large data sets in named tables, and do look ups using index match, and write formulas to do what I need them to do.  Additionally, I can manipulate pivot tables pretty well.  I'm to a point, where VBA macros are the next step, but without any programming experience, this will prove difficult.  

My new interest is in using the importrange and query functions in excel to manage project and look up aspects of large data sets.

I'm very interested in data science and feel that the skills I have currently will complement the new skills I want to learn.
